          <h2>Idli</h2>
          Idli is a fluffy, moon-like steamed south Indian rice cake. Learn how to make the most perfect and authentic idli batter and idlis at home.

Even better, they are oil-free.Fluffy, soft idli in a silver tray with a bowl of coconut chutney and curry leaves in the background.If you love fermented foods and understand the immense benefits they bring to your health, you should be making Idli, a five-ingredient food that originated in south India and has dug roots in kitchens across the rest of India and in Indian kitchens around the world.South Indian dishes popularized by restaurants, like dosa, adai, sambar, and pongal, are usually immensely healthy. And that's more true of idli than almost any of these other foods. This porous, fluffy white disc could easily be the healthiest food in the world and it is made of two basic and very healthy building blocks -- rice and lentils. Eaten by itself, an idli tastes bland. But served with a sambar and a green coconut chutney, it becomes one of the most delicious foods you will ever eat. This is also food for everyone--and anytime. Gluten-free? You can't do better than an idli with its perfect-protein combination. Trying to lose weight? Idlis are extremely low-calorie, fat-free and probiotic and can be great for weight loss. Sick? An idli will nurture your digestive system right back to health. Picky eater? No kid can resist a soft little moon to dunk into creamy, savory, green coconut chutney. And you can eat an idli at any time -- it makes a delicious south Indian breakfast, lunch or dinner.
